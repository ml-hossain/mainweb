CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS seo_settings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  market VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  keywords JSONB,
  meta_data JSONB,
  content_optimization JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_seo_settings_market ON seo_settings(market);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_seo_settings_updated_at ON seo_settings(updated_at);
```
